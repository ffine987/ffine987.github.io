    <h1>Why Faith/Arcane builds whip butt in Elden Ring</h1>
    <p>This is my page and now you have to read what it says, sorry sucker. <strong>Elden Ring</strong> is 
    one of the coolest games <strong>ever</strong> and the coolest build of all is <strong>Faith/Arcane</strong>. 
    It's by far the most versatile build in the game, and I've tried them all. On one hand, you get access to 
    <strong>three</strong> elements plus a myriad of utility incantations from Faith. On the other hand, you get 
    to use arcane-scaling weapons, which deal <strong>insane</strong> amounts of bleed damage, evaporating most 
    enemies. Then on top of that, you get special access to <strong>DRAGON INCANTATIONS</strong>, that
    let you summon the awesome powers of ancient dragons to smite your foes. These spells are incredibly pricy
    in terms of your mana, but oh so worth it, even just for the grand spectacle of summoning a massive dragon
    head to <strong>roast your foes to a crisp</strong>. <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Dragonclaw" 
    title="cool spell" target="_blank">Check out this wiki page for my favorite spell in the game, that involves 
    summoning a massive dragon arm from the sky to crush your enemies into dust.</a></p>

    Below is a picture I found of a dragon holding a lightning bolt - enjoy.<br>
